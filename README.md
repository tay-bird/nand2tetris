I first completed the Nand2Tetris course in.. 2012? 2014? A long time ago. I'm revisiting it again in 2022, because why not? I never get this close to hardware in my cloud engineering jobs. It's good to get back to basics. :)

project 01

- I cheated on the first mux. Had no idea how to do this after an hour thinking about it. Learned that there's two ways to do it - with a NOT and three NANDS, or a NOT, two ANDs, and an OR. I wonder if there's an electrical engineering reason to do one vs the other.

- I made the DMux4Way and DMux8Way with AND gates rather than just chaining together DMux gates. Dunno why that didn't occur to me. I actually made an And3Way to facilitate this lol.

project 02

- Man the full adder took me way longer than it should have lol
